Reducers is a functionality to manage the state changes. It is high level than original state of React. The Reducer function will accepts two parameter. One for state data and other for user action which is what sort of operations user do. I just try this for a sample, but it was kind of useful. Just list code below:

#### Description:
* state is state I define inside of main component, in here just to store a number to count. 
* action is a user operation which are click button either increment or decrement in this case.
* action has second parameter which called payload just to pass a value that what I want to change.

```javascript
// import useReducer
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

// define reducer function outside the component
const reducer = (state, action) => {
    // state === { count: number }
    // action === { type: 'increment' || 'decrement, payload: 1 }
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
            return { ...state, count: state.count + action.payload };
            break;
        case 'decrement':
            return { ...state, count: state.count - action.payload };
            break;
        default:
            return state;
            break;
    }
}

// component
const CounterScreen = () => {
    // define useReducer state, default value by 0, and ref reducer function we have define above
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });
    return (
        <View>
            <Button
                title="Increease"
                // use dispatch methode to call reducer, pass the type of action and the value of action with two parameter
                onPress={() => {
                    dispatch({ type: 'increment', payload: 1 });
                }}>
            </Button>
            <Button
                title="Decreease"
                onPress={() => {
                    dispatch({ type: 'decrement', payload: 1 });
                }}
            ></Button>
            // output the state.count value just like use normal state
            <Text>Current Count: {state.count}</Text>
        </View>
    )
};
```
