Today was a busy day as well as my first day to attend Dunedin Codecraft activity. Interestingly, I wrote two questions on July 28 and I was wondering to ask Adon when he is free. But before he answered the questions that I wanted to ask in class yesterday, so I came to this event today. At about 5:30 pm in the 102 of D block, about 20 people attended.

At the beginning we asked the initiator what the topic is? He explained that normally we have topics, but today we are face to face conversations. After waiting for about ten minutes, everyone arrived. I didn't expect two people here to prepare their own topic and slides.

Since the first person speak too faster, I basically didn't understand what he said. Fortunately, he has a PPT, so I probably know that they have developed an IoT project for large farms that can be used to track objects by installing sensors. I also talked about the company's development process. I think he is probably promoting his project. During this period, many people also asked questions.

The second person speak much longer. He proposed the dev/ops concept, which basically puts all the processes in the software industry together. From the aspects of development, testing, deployment, configuration, operation and maintenance, management, etc., the complexity of the problem and the necessity of advanced management are explained. 

At the same time, many domain and software names have been proposed. Such as nagios, openstack, docker, LXC, AWS, AZURE and so on. He also specifically mentioned the juju and charms, although I still don't understand what it is, a tool he prefers. It is said that the relationship between the various components can be managed through a protocol. 

Because the time is too short, the content is too much, and the problem is not deep enough, most of audiences may have some doubts and raise many questions of critical thinking. I think maybe because he is a professor at a university, all things are not practical enough, a little bit acadmic. 

But anyway, I have learned a lot of new concepts, which is a good harvest.
