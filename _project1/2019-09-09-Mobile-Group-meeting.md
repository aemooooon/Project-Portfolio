At the time of the regular meeting, this week, Carthor and I did not assign too many functional tasks. We are only fixing some bugs and warnings encountered in the first 3 Sprints. 
So this Sprint we just set one week. My entire work process was also very smooth, and basically completed what should be fixed.
