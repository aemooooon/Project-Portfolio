As I said at Debrief 2, today we met our client Claire as scheduled. Carthor made an appointment to meet at our project classroom at 12 noon today. I waited until 11 o'clock from the gym. More nervous, because I am afraid that English is not good enough to affect communication, I have a super unconfident. In fact, I feel liking more dependent on Carthor and hopes that he will come earlier, but unfortunately he was a few minutes late because of traffic jams. And our client are coming on time. Before I only knew that it was a woman, I can see from the email address that it was a high school staff in Otago. But when I met, I was particularly surprised. Because I watched two girls wearing high school uniforms come in, I guess it should be, by greeting, I knows that she is currently only a year 12 student. I am not so nervous at the moment, because my daughter is also in high school and still in the year 13, it is inevitable that there will be some common topics to avoid embarrassment.

I showed her all the work and project tensions and effects we have had over the past 9 weeks. She feels very satisfied, and also discusses in detail some details such as the need to correct and improve. In addition, I learned that she still had some original intentions and prototype design about the project, so I also hope that she will send it to me. She also painted some for me on the spot. 

What else do you need to do next? 
She also talked about her thoughts, such as hoping to have a circle of friends, so that friends can see each other's sports records, which can improve everyone's motivation and encouragement. Because the movement is good, it is also the perseverance that requires patience and long-term persistence.

Finally, Carthor recorded all the conversations and wrote them on paper. I think these things are our next tasks. I think today is a very successful communication.
