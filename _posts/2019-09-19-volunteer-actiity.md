Now I am a student in the Database 3. I almost remember when I was doing Database 1 with Vaughn,  We asked the third year project data model and resoures from senior student. And they guys do some presentation to us. Today comes a new year 1 student, and our role has been exchanged. In fact, I was waiting for them with a full enthusiasm, and I also introduced us on behalf of our entire mobile development project group.

But until the end, no one came to consult our project, I don't know why? 
Don't everyone like the mobile project? 
Or for no other reason, there is absolutely no reason. 
During the period, only two friends of Flinn came to consult the questions about the future course selection. Of course, we also talked a lot with enthusiasm about the future direction. I said that about class selection, everyone is different, depending on what you want to be in the future? He replied to the network, then I introduced the network series, Linux, system management, virtualization, and more.


Of course, I also thought about it carefully, if someone asked me about the database. In fact, our mobile project group uses document-based databases such as Google Firebase and MongoDB, and we don't have too complicated relational database models to provide. 
So what? 
Of course, this is also a meaningful event.
