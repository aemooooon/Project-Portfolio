The Sprint 5 from Sep 12, 2019 to Sep 26, 2019. Pretty much two weeks as well as are last two weeks before middle holiday. I just realize we haven't done the core features yet, but we have spent more than half semester. So it's time to do some core features, major functionility. We  So we assigned the task below:

> Hua

* Feature 24 - Add button to start running - #33 
* Feature 23 - Showing route distance and minutes on marker - #32 

> Curthor

* Feature 22 - Adding user permission prompt - #31 
* Feature 21 - Displaying custom icons in area without markers - #30

I have look at the prototype of our client and learned some of the opinions of others on the Internet. I brainstormed a manuscript.

Of course, I also did it according to this. During the period, it was interesting that I separated the operation part as a subcomponent. Because I can't put all the files in the Map component, so the data is passed between the components. The callback function is a place that I need to learn. 

In addition, the operation interface that cannot be displayed is displayed according to different conditions or not displayed. Another problem is that React Native's radio button is especially difficult to use, so I simply made one with the expo icon, I think it is quite good, just need to set a few more states.
