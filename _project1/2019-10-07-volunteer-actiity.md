Since I had been participated so many activities of the Student Success department of Otago Polytech. I get a new task in this middle holiday, Yvonne has sent the email to me that hope I could talk a English level 3 student from Dalian, China. The appointment has set up on the 11 am Monday 7th, October.

I origanal feel like might be Carter who I am talking about to just ask something like English learning problems. Because I have some experience in Otago polytech English Language Center, so I think maybe could give him some suggestion. But the supprises is that just ask some normal question about how properly interact with local people. I understood that is cultural shocking beging come with him, he is in the sencond stage of the curtural shocking. Such as food, make new different cultural friends, and language barrier and so on. So I just share him some experience from my past life and what the thing should be careful to do. Almost 20 minutes. Such a good talking. I hope this talking could help him.
