On the third day of Sprint 3, Mobile Group Routine Meeting, as it is, everyone reported on the progress of their work. Since I am not familiar with the use of Google Map Directions. I started doing research and started trying to implement these features on the first night of my Sprint. Fortunately, I quickly found some methods, so I quickly reported my experience and work to our boss Grayson. 

At the same time, because it is my other two papers which are Algorithms and Data Structures and Virtualization will close the due date, I need to redouble my efforts to complete the task ahead of time.
