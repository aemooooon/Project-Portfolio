Today after the Mobile Group Meeting, Carthor with me make a email to our client Claire first time. Sorry, once again spit my English skills. I have no confidence at all to communicate with customers because I am afraid that mistakes will affect the team. So Carthor sent this email with me, and he was responsible for writing. 

We asked for some further information about our project, mainly on how to divide the area with polygons, because it is usually divided according to the urban area, but in any case must follow the customer's needs.
