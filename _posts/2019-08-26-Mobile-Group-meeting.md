At today's session, all of our memeber of project 1, project 2 and lecturers attended a conference, the first time since the start of the 5th week. 
In fact, there are no special tasks announced, just to talk like family sitting together. I took a photo for everyone and used it to remember.

Everyone has expressed their own ideas and reported what they have done in the past five weeks, how the current project is going, and so on. 
I feel that everyone is doing very well, but I am not doing very well. Maybe because of the language barrier, I was working on User Profile features, but it seems that this is not the key point of our project. The lecturer told me not to waste time on it, and the people of these project 2 have already completed, so that I can take a look at their code. 
I think it's not good to look at other people's code directly. At least I have to organize my mind and question and find the answer by myself.

Oh, no matter what, I have to keep working hard!
