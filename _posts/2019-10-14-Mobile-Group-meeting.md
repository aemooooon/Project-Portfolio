Someone did a heaps of working and someone did not. I have done a lot of things, because I want do better, also someting I haven't make it clear before, but it was a good time to think about that in holiday. The detail I have wrote a blog to recrod it.

We only have six weeks available, so my plan is finishing the main feature as soon as possible, I hope we can record a user entire workout routing, includes calculating distance, duration, caloriy, and also create fridends system to share each of workout record.
