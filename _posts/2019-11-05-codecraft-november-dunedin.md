It has been a long time I haven't go participating in the Codecraft activity. Because either the event location far away or the topic does not relevant by BIT stuff. Today the activity is running on our campus actually it is located on our BIT block 1 floor, as well as they are going to talk about programming and Artificial Intelligence. So I am apparently going to.

I arrived there at half-past five, approximately 20 people already sitting there. I just pick up a chair took a seat and they started soon. There were three people to presented, topic are Does Artificial Intelligence could be creative?, Asp.NET Core 3.0 and the story of the Indexer.

The first topic is not too technic, but it was fun. He made a lot of jokes although I did not get it really. He produced too many slides and did not present all due to the 30 minutes time limit. Finally, the female moderator interrupted him and shift the second speaker.

The second man is an expert of C#, he said that is been developed with c# more than 7 years so far. He talked about dot Net Core's history and version evolution, also talked about the C# 8.0 new features, such as synchronization, slice, and very brief syntax to switch statements. It is kind of cool for developer, but I know most of the features are learned from other languages like Python or Javascript. I just want to ask him that is there any library like the Python Numpy that could be calculated with vectorization?

The third man was more serious, he did not make any jokes, but actually everybody gets laughing, because of some honest present. He talked about C++, Index, Hashtable and Red-Black Tree and so on. I did not get all from the context, it seems like a very high-level data structure or super optimization.

Anyway, that was a very nice experience for me. Good presentation, good to hear.
