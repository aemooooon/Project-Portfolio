Tomorrow will be our last day this semester, it is also Showcase day which one of the most important BIT activity. Even though We haven't completely meet all the requirements from our client. I considered that I still need to tell client what we have done though? So I should send a email talk to client and report all progresses as well as invite her come to our Showcase I can present our final product to her. But maybe she currently doing exam as well, I haven't get any answer from her yet!
