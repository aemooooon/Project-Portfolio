I have heard this activity and project mentioned by Adon last week. Also received an email with an invitation link this morning, I am quickly registered and logged in. 
And understood the main features of this project. At one o'clock in the afternoon, the responsible women came to our project studio on time and started a 30-minute demonstration.

Slides were used during the period and Youtube videos were played. Probably a website that provides a platform for students and employers to know each other. I think the reason they do this project is because Otago polytech could provide a large potential user. She will be particularly detailed, especially on specific functional operations. I just want to say that we are here BIT Block, we may only need a simple description, no specific operation instructions, because we all understand.

Also as a web developer, I checked this web site and found that there are still many issues need to be further improved.
