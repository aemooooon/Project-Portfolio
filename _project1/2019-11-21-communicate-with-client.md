Tomorrow will be our last day this semester, also it is Showcase day which one of the very important BIT activity. Eventhough We haven't absluotely meet all the requirements from our client. I think that I still need tell client what we have done though? So I need send a email talk to client, I report all progresses and invait her come to our Showcase I can present our final product to her. But maybe it is the time her doing exam as well, So up to now, her haven't answer me yet!
