It is time to design a logo for our App. As a BIT student, we are professional, although I did not take the Multi-Media paper, I think I should try to make a Icon and splash icon pictures. So just use Photoshop put some character which our project name on there and draw some color. It not perfect, but still is a learnning experiences though.
