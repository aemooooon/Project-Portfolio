Today is the second week, I think it is time to know the topic detail of our project. Our lecturer, Grayson Orr, had a meeting with three of us for almost half an hour in the room next to the Rob office. 
During the period he explained two projects to us:

The first one is a traditional Java-based Android application. Here are two toys called Beyblade, which will have sensors in side that can read the speed of the toy, X, Y, Z dimensions and other data. 
Read this data and display it, this is the basic function. 
when project go further, it could read multi-player data and compare it to show the winner or loser, and finally save it to the database. It could also store or edit the player's profile information.

The second project is an app that is similar to games but can help people exercise, using Facebook's React Native technology. 
The App loads the Google Map and can mark some target points. The user can locate his current location through the mobile phone, record the user's location and calculate the route when the user runs, and give the user some reward points when the user reaches these target points. At the same time, users can manage their own profile information, basic addition, deletion, modification and viewing.


Later on, Isaiah Tee, Carthur Pongpatimet and me, the three of us decided that Isaiah Tee would take the first project I mentioned above, that is Beyblade which is also a single-person project. 
So definately, Carthur Pongpatimet and I will go take a second project. 

In this process, I would like to thank all the mate and the lecturer for their patience, because there are a lot of details I didn't fully understand at the first time, so thank them for their detailed explanation.


Next, we set up our own development environment. The lecturer Grayson and other Project 2 students also helped me. I also encountered some problems. I will record it in another post.
