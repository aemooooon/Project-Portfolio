___Project___, which has been looking forward to for two years, has finally come to me. There are some expectations, some surprises, and some tensions.

In the first session of the first day of the third year, Adon gave us a brief and comprehensive introduction to all the students who entered the project and the students who had completed the first project and were about to enter the second project. Adon is a super-smart, brain-responsive, and humorous person. I remember last year at a internal open-day presentation.

To create a fair and everyone-friendly working environment, everyone Need to be do good by himself first.

The following Topics in various directions are available for us to choose from:
* Operations & Security
* Mobile App Development
* Internet of Things
* Web Development
* Game Development
* Gaze toolbar
* Stroke rehabilitation
* Machine learning/artificial intelligence

I have thought about what kind of project I will choose for thousands of times. ^=^

In terms of Game development, by took Programming 4 last semester, I found that I didn't would to be like that when I was young so much love game. About LoT, because I haven't taken any courses on embedded development and robotics, I haven't studied Cisco courses on the Internet, so if putting all these things together is more difficult for me. Meanwhile, things like machine learning, I think I will find it more difficult, because I have not yet studied these courses. So
