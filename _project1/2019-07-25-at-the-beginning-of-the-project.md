Project, which has been looking forward to for two years, has finally come to me. There are some expectations, some surprises, and some tensions.

In the first session of the first day of the third year, Adon gave us a brief and comprehensive introduction to all the students who entered the project and the students who had completed the first project and were about to enter the second project. Adon is a super-smart, brain-responsive, and humorous person. I remember last year at a internal open-day presentation. He said: I don't want to present the project too much here, because each of you must choose this paper. The meaning of the words reveals a domineering and humorous opinion.


On this session he was Speaking a lot of topic, such as Housekeeping, Rob also said that I am not your mother... and about campus bullying and discrimination. I think that for the students working in the Project room, the lecturer have considered a lot and hope to take care of everyone. After all, in a real working environment, these are very important. To create a fair and everyone-friendly working environment, everyone Need to be do good by himself first.
