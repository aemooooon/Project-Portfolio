Today was a busy day as well as my first day to attend Dunedin Codecraft activity. Interestingly, I wrote two questions on July 28 and I was wondering to ask Adon when he is free. But before he answered the questions that I wanted to ask in class yesterday, so I came to this event today. At about 5:30 pm in the 102 of D block, about 20 people attended.

At the beginning we asked the initiator what the topic is? He explained that normally we have topics, but today we are face to face conversations. After waiting for about ten minutes, everyone arrived. I didn't expect two people here to prepare their own topic and slides.
