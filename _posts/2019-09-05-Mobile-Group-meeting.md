It has being the end of the Sprint 3. Mobile Group Routine Meeting. This week is the busiest week since the semester, facing the huge workload of the third year, and tomorrow is the due date of two assignments. Busy and full. Fortunately, I basically completed all the tasks. Maybe it's not perfect, but at least I tried hard. Still as before, I honestly reported my work to everyone, and of course everyone said their own.
