In the first Sprint, I and Carthor each assigned 2 tasks, I was responsible for the user Sign up and login page, and created a database account, the request is based on document type data such as Firebase or MongoDB, I chose Firebase.

first of all, because I used MongoDB before learning web 3, although I am not mastering about that, I hope to get as much contact with different products and technologies as possible during my entire BIT learning process. 

Secondly, Firebase is a real-time database, very interesting, and also a product of Google. I think there should be a lot of attractive places worth exploring.

Carthor is responsible for creating the map and adding the user's marker to the map. Of course, although it is not my task, I spent a lot of time doing research on how to implement map functions on mobile apps. In React Native, there is a library called React Native Map that provides us with convenience. 

It is also an API for calling Google Maps, but it integrates many existing features, and it is more convenient to use directly, and compatibility with React Native is also good.

In this Sprint, we didn't complete toooo much features, just symbolically completed the basic skeleton of these two main modules, so that the App can run whether it is on the desktop simulator or on the real mobile phone we use.
