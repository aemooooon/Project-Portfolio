Today is a special day which is the autumn begins(立秋) in the traditional Chinese lunar calendar, also luch number with day and month. :)

The React-Native development environment has exhausted my two weeks of patience. Various errors appeared on the both of my own computer and project room one.  But today is a good day, because I don't know somehow Adon suddenly told us that the Chinese Scholarship GROUP will visit our project class at 2 pm after our project meeting.

As a person who can speak Mandarin as well as is really familiar with our project profile, I am definitely really willing and happy to be a translator or a bridge in the middle. In short, I can make my own contribution to the perfect communication of each other. Awesome!!!

First of all, Adon welcomed them, and then gave a brief introduction to our third year of learning objectives, process and task assignments, assessment criteria, project categories, etc. There is also a female translator accompanied by translation. When it comes to specific projects and groups, the translator says that I don't know much about technology. Maybe this can be expressed directly by yours (Yandong Qiao, Ke Wang and me).

Then I started directly from the left corner Operations & Security team, then Artificial Intelligence, Mobile Development, Web Development, Iot, etc. 
With a little nervousness, too many people stood opposite me, blocking the Jony and Game Development teams. I forgot to introduce these two projects, but it is very amazing that Adon seems to understand the Mandarin I speak, and he reminded me in time. 

Then I said that because you have a lot of people (about 17 people), you can also divide into a couple of groups and go to different team to visit and have a face-to-face introduction and communication with our classmates. Later on Yandong, Ke and I led some of them to different groups. I took them to see Operations & security, and the Artificial Intelligence ​​team. 

Some teachers understand technology, some teachers care about specific assessment criteria and so on. Everyone’s key point is different. After standing together, everyone asked a lot of questions. I also answered them one by one. During the conversation, I known that they were the teachers and management team of a university in Shenzhen. Two of them were actually from Wuhan University and had a feeling of being a fellow. 
Unconsciously an hour passed, it is time to say goodbye to them.


Finally, Adon said good job to us. what a delighted！
