___Project___, which has been looking forward to for two years, has finally come to me. There are some expectations, some surprises, and some tensions.

This is the first session of the first day of the third year, Adon gave us a brief and comprehensive introduction to all the students who entered the project and the students who had completed the first project and were about to enter the second project. Adon is a super-smart, brain-responsive, and humorous person. I remember last year at a internal open-day presentation. He said: I don't want to present the project too much here, because each of you must choose this paper. The meaning of the words reveals a domineering and humorous opinion.


Lecturer's were Speaking a lot of topic, such as Housekeeping, Rob also said that I am not your mother... and about campus bullying and discrimination. I think that for the students working in the Project room, the lecturer have considered a lot and hope to take care of everyone. After all, in a real working environment, these are very important. To create a fair and everyone-friendly working environment, everyone Need to be do good by himself first.

The following Topics in various directions are available for us to choose from:
* Operations & Security
* Mobile App Development
* Internet of Things
* Web Development
* Game Development
* Gaze toolbar
* Stroke rehabilitation
* Machine learning/artificial intelligence

I have thought about what kind of project I will choose for thousands of times. ^=^
About Operations, Because I have studied Linux, SystemAdmin, I could choose it, but this project has some problems which is need really accurate communication. unfortunately, I am not good at comunicate with English. 

In terms of Game development, by took Programming 4 last semester, I found that I didn't would to be like that when I was young so much love game. 

About LoT, because I haven't taken any courses on embedded development and robotics, I haven't studied Cisco Network courses on the Internet, so if putting all these things together is more difficult for me. 

Meanwhile, things like machine learning, I think I will find it more difficult, because I have not yet studied these courses. 

finally, for me only mobile development and web development are left to choose from. I am really confident on web development, not only because I have completed the Web 3 paper, but also I have had a couple of years of Web development experience, even though the technique skills used at that time is outdated, but the basic HTTP principle is unchanged anymore.

After my discussions with all the groups, classmates, and lecturer, I was asked, and I finally thought I should decide to choose mobile development. why?

Firstly, I do not need take the Mobile Development Paper in the last semester, and give me a chance to take Quality Assurance and
Software Testing paper, so I might get a cetificate, which may make it easier for me to find a job and improve the breadth of my resume after I graduate.

Secondly, since I have done Web 3 paper, Adon has taught me the technique of React, and this time the Mobile Development is going to use React Native to do. I was thinking that adds to my confidence.

In the second session, Adon gave us a place for each project group, and introduced the lecturer, let us go to their respective teams. I entered the Mobile Development team led by Grayson with 6 other people. Three newbies which are Isaiah Tee, Carthur Pongpatimet and me will take Project 1, and then three people will start the Project 2. After the simple meeeting, we assigned computer, all of which are exclusive to the dual screen. It can be seen that Polytech is a very forward-looking and user-friendly school with a very good atmosphere. Later on, we started to adapt our own position, look at the documentation on react, and I started testing and learning about David's Diversity Project.
