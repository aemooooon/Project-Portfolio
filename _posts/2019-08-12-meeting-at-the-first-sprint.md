The first Sprint will end this week, and I have a pretty one hour meeting with Carthur. We summed up the work tasks of the previous week and how to implement them, and so on. Each of us also exchanged ideas with. He showed me the results of his work, successfully loaded Google Maps to the App homepage, and knew how to add markers to the map. It also tracks the user's current location.

And I also told him the results of my work. I have Created the firebase account and conducted a research, already know how to add, delete and update data. At the same time, some modules such as authorization and creation of users are implemented for the user's registration and login functions.

In addiation, we also discussed the next work together, and made some simple page design and basic content skeleton planning. I hope that in the next Sprint we can accomplish what we think is the basic thing. We are going to work on with the task below:

## Hua WANG

* feature 13 - validation for input authentication fields
* feature 12 - separating sign up and log in

## Carthur

* featrue 3 - add geofencing
* feature 11 - Add running location to map as different markers
* feature 15 - adding latitude/longitude coordinates to the database
