From Student Moodle center, I found the External engagement and professional development. Adon encourages us to do IT-related volunteering which is individual professional development activities. Not only can we enrich our project experience, but it can also increase our value in our resume.

For me, I should go to do more volunteer activities. Compared with my professional skills and abilities, I should improve my English listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. Because once I apply for a job after graduation, the bottom line is that I must be able to communicate and communicate with my future colleagues in an accurate and fluent manner. 

So I have to do it forwardly.

For the second year in my BIT, I was a Peer tutor at the Polytech.  helping some low level students improve their programming abilities. I think I am good at programming.

Just in the classroom of the database 3, Krissy wood said that the programming 1 class needs volunteer tutors to help the net students to try programming, because this year I heard that there are some real newbies. 

So I took the initiative to send Krissi Wood an email and applied for it. I think this is a very good opportunity to communicate with them. Although I don't completly understand English, I know C#, so I believe I must have no problem. 

I also thank Krissi for his support of my volunteer activities.

July 30, 2019. Today is the first time I have volunteered. There are more than a dozen students, so I am still getting some nervous, mainly because there is no confidence.

I took my textbook which used 2 years ago and sat in the last row. 
Listen to Krissi with other students to explain the new lab. After the end, everyone started to practice, do the lab. I turned around the classroom to see who needed help or hands up. 

Krissi also gave me a new book because some of it has been updated. 
During the period, almost five or six students hands up and asked me questions. 

Because of the current basic knowledge such as syntax, input and output, the use of simple operators. So even if I didn't understand it, I can see their problems at a glance. 

So this makes my job easier. I am still very enjoyable. Thank you.
