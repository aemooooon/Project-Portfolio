How time flies, half of the first half of the third year has passed. Today is our second Debrief as well as the end date of our Sprint 4. 
About dDebrief, all thing still the same, I was the first to talk to our boss, Grayson. The specific content is similar to the first time, so I am not writing down anymore here.

At the end of Sprint 4, our project basically has a skeleton. Whether it is with the customer or the boss, I and Carthor feel that we can show the basic functions. So we merged all the features and submitted the merge request into the Master branch. At the same time, we feel that we should have an in-depth conversation with our client. 

Because what happens next?  What do customers think? 

We are not clear, so we hope to have a meeting with the customer, so we sent an email to the customer to make an appointment, I hope to discuss it in detail next week.

With two weeks left in the middle holiday, we feel that Sprint 5 is implemented in the past two weeks. For the current project needs, the following features to be completed are listed:

* Feature 25 - drawing route that user ran while they are running #34 
* Feature 24 - Add button to start running #33 
* Feature 23 - Showing route distance and minutes on marker #32
* Feature 22 - Adding user permission prompt #31 
* Feature 21 - Displaying custom icons in area without markers #30
* feature 6 - designs for screens #7
