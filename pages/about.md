Welcome! 你好, I'm Aemooooon

As a student, I am writing the blog here to record my learning experience. It's not only to the teacher's assesment, but also is possible to review again in case I forget it in the future. And also is a good way to practise my English writing skills. My name is Hua WANG and studying Bachelor of Information Technology in Otago Polytech.

Currently in my first semester of the third year, I will work with Carthur Pongpatimet to develop an Android-based app, an app similar to helping people exercise. The software framework is based on Facebook's React Native technology and needs to be call Google's Maps API, the phone sensor to locate the user's location, and record the user's route, when the user gets a fixed target point, will get some reward points. 

This is our Project 1 project and we must complete it within this semester.
