Regarding the Openmind App, I originally thought it was just a questionnaire. But with my further involvement, I found this to be a very interesting study and test. I also quickly understood the original intention of the Lecturer to let us participate in this activity. The goal is to make us as effictive as possible in future team working activities.

For the team work, everyone is unique, but also has a different cultural background, inevitably have different opinions on the way of thinking and thinking. 

For example, I am from the East, and Kiwi thinking is basically derived from Western culture, so it is particularly normal to have differences of opinion here. If in some respects we can tolerate and accept each other's points, not so overconfident, this will improve Our. 

For example, I am from China, and I have Confucian doctrine of the mean in my heart. Everything is used to maintaining a balance. At the same time, because of China's national conditions and historical reasons, compared with the students from the West, I do not have very open mind thinking, and the critical thinking of the West is also not available much to me.

This App bascally from below way to improve us:
> Understand the value of viewpoint diversity. Begin by learning about the advantages of having your beliefs challenged, and of discovering that on some issues, you may have been wrong about something.

> Cultivate humility and open-mindedness. Read short quotations from wise thinkers – East and West – that will help you attain a mindset of humility and openness.

> Look inside the mind. Learn a little bit of cognitive science to see the tricks the mind plays on us, making us all prompt to be self-righteous, overconfident, and quick to demonize alternative perspectives.

> Understand the moral matrix. Learn how each team or tribe builds a comprehensive worldview that can explain everything, while making it harder for its members to think for themselves.

> Venture beyond your moral matrix. Step outside your own moral matrix by exploring the mindsets, perspectives, and principles of different political ideologies, religious traditions or lack thereof, cultural values, etc.

> Prepare for challenging conversations. Practice some skills – such as cognitive reappraisal, acknowledgment, and perspective taking – that will help you to talk, work, and engage productively with people whose ideas and values differ from yours.

At the moment, I don't know how to interpret the results of this result. In the finnal my result is 69%. I don't know if this is good or not. From a traditional perspective, the higher score is more better though? 

But I accept it. Maybe my English is not good. I don't understand the true meaning of some of these topics. Maybe I still need to improve in many aspects. In short words, people's life needs to be constantly learning, and I am on the way to learning.
