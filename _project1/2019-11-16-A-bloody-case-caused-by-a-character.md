I felt bored last night just want to experience the latest Windows 10 terminal, and then updated the system by the way, and also updated the nodejs, and found that I could not start my project today. I really think that I am very bad, the last week of the semester, all the features are completed, just upload the project to the google play store, and this happened. 

Itâ€™s sad! 

The key is that I am constantly deleting, reinstalling, and updating can't solve the problem. It took me nearly three hours to finally find a solution. So I think that is valued to record here.

error output like:

```bash
wanghua@Aemon MINGW64 /d/GoogleDrives/2019S2/Project1/excercise-app/ExerciseApp (clean-up)    
$ expo start

solutions: update file locate at: ./node_modules/metro-config/src/defaults/blacklist.js

```jsx
var sharedBlacklist = [
  /node_modules[/\\]react[/\\]dist[/\\].*/,
  /website\/node_modules\/.*/,
  /heapCapture\/bundle\.js/,
  /.*\/__tests__\/.*/
];

// change to

var sharedBlacklist = [
